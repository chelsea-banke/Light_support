# AI-Driven Fault Reporting and Support Management System

This project is a smart fault reporting and asset support platform for power distribution companies. It leverages artificial intelligence and geolocation services to streamline the reporting, classification, assignment, and resolution of infrastructure faults, particularly consumer-side faults like electricity meter issues.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional fault resolution processes in utility companies are often slow and fragmented. This system introduces an AI-driven, centralized platform that:

- Allows consumers to report faults using a chat interface
- Automatically categorizes and triages faults using an AI agent
- Provides real-time updates and mapping for field technicians
- Equips administrators with a dashboard for full system oversight

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 AI-powered chatbot for fault intake
- 🗺️ Geolocation-based technician dispatch and tracking
- 📱 Mobile apps for consumers and technicians (React Native)
- 🖥️ Web dashboard for admin management (ReactJS)
- 🔗 REST API backend (Spring Boot)
- 🧠 AI Agent for smart ticket management (LLamaIndex)
- 🗃️ MySQL database integration
- 🔐 Role-based access control and secure data handling
