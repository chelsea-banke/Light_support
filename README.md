# AI-Driven Fault Reporting and Support Management System

This project is a smart fault reporting and asset support platform for power distribution companies. It leverages artificial intelligence and geolocation services to streamline the reporting, classification, assignment, and resolution of infrastructure faults, particularly consumer-side faults like electricity meter issues.

- Allows consumers to report faults using a chat interface
- Automatically categorizes and triages faults using an AI agent
- Provides real-time updates and mapping for field technicians
- Equips administrators with a dashboard for full system oversight
